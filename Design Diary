Design diary 5/11/2020

Pivoted on the project and decided to take on something more
structured: A race car game. I began implementing last night
following along with tutorials on using pygame to create a top
down 2D racing game where you avoid objects while driving a race
car. The objects come from the top of the screen and I wrote code
that defines boundaries for the car, and also interaction between the
car and the falling objects. If the car is hit by an object a screen
will read "You died". Also added a score counter for objects.
